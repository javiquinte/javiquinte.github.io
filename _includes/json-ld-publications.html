            "abstract": "New data acquisition techniques are generating data at much finer temporal and spatial resolution, compared to traditional seismic experiments. This is a challenge for data centers and users. As the amount of data potentially flowing into data centers increases by one or two orders of magnitude, data management challenges are found throughout all stages of the data flow. The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology—Réseau sismologique et géodésique français and GEOForschungsNetz data centers—carried out a survey and conducted interviews of users working with very large datasets to understand their needs and expectations. One of the conclusions is that existing data formats and services are not well suited for users of large datasets. Data centers are exploring storage solutions, data formats, and data delivery options to meet large dataset user needs. New approaches will need to be discussed within the community, to establish large dataset standards and best practices, perhaps through participation of stakeholders and users in discussion groups and forums.",

The seismic network has regional focus in Europe and North Africa as well as throughout the Indian Ocean, but it operates stations on all continents, including Greenland on the North American continental plate and Antarctica. The data center provides real‐time seismic data through the SeedLink protocol and historical data from its large archive that currently comprises 120 TB of temporary and permanent seismic network data from GeoForschungsZentrums and third‐party partners made available via standard services as part of the European Integrated Data Archive and within the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks. GEOFON also provides global and rapid earthquake information. The rapid earthquake information service prioritizes fast information dissemination globally after moderate and large earthquakes based on automatic processing. Most operations are carried out using the SeisComP system. GEOFON distributes findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable data, services, products, and software free of charge, and it is used worldwide by hundreds of users and other data centers.",

            "abstract": "The European Integrated Data Archive (EIDA) is the infrastructure that provides access to the seismic‐waveform archives collected by European agencies. This distributed system is managed by Observatories and Research Facilities for European Seismology. EIDA provides seamless access to seismic data from 12 data archives across Europe by means of standard services, exposing data on behalf of hundreds of network operators and research organizations. More than 12,000 stations from permanent and temporary networks equipped with seismometers, accelerometers, pressure sensors, and other sensors are accessible through the EIDA federated services. A growing user base currently counting around 3000 unique users per year has been requesting data and using EIDA services. The EIDA system is designed to scale up to support additional new services, data types, and nodes. Data holdings, services, and user numbers have grown substantially since the establishment of EIDA in 2013. EIDA is currently active in developing suitable data management approaches for new emerging technologies (e.g., distributed acoustic sensing) and challenges related to big datasets. This article reviews the evolution of EIDA, the current data holdings, and service portfolio, and gives an outlook on the current developments and the future envisaged challenges.",

            "abstract": "Deformation in the orogen-foreland system of the southern Central Andes between 33° and 36° S varies in style, locus, and amount of shortening. The controls that determine these spatially variable characteristics have largely remained unknown, yet both the subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate and the strength of the South American plate have been invoked to play a major role. While the parameters governing the subduction processes are similar between 33° and 36° S, the lithospheric strength of the upper plate is spatially variable due to structures inherited from past geodynamic regimes and associated compositional differences in the South American plate. Regional Mesozoic crustal horizontal extension generated a < 40-km-thick crust with a more mafic composition in the lower crust south of 35°S; north of this latitude, however, a more felsic lower crust is inferred from geophysical data. To assess the influence of different structural and compositional heterogeneities on the style of deformation in the southern Central Andes, we developed a suite of geodynamic models of intraplate lithospheric shortening for two E–W transects (33° 40′ S and 36° S) across the Andes. The models are constrained by local geological and geophysical information. Our results demonstrate a decoupled shortening mode between the brittle upper crust and the ductile lower crust in those areas characterized by a mafic lower crust (36° S transect). In contrast, a more felsic lower crust, such as in the 33° 40′ S transect, results in a coupled shortening mode. Furthermore, we find that differences in lithospheric thickness and the asymmetry of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary may promote the formation of a crustal-scale, west-dipping detachment zone that drives the overall deformation and lateral expansion of the orogen. Our study represents the first geodynamic modeling effort in the southern Central Andes aimed at understanding the roles of heterogeneities (crustal composition and thickness) at the scale of the entire lithosphere as well as the geometry of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary with respect to mountain building.",
