I discovered recently that I love to run and since then I can hardly stop going out for a run every time I can.

After some months of intensive training I tried to take part in any competition but the season was almost over.
The last chance was to go for the `Great 10K of Berlin` and, honestly speaking, it was one of the best things
I've done in the last years.

The race course was beautiful and I was lucky and had a great performance, considering that I'm a recent runner.  ;-)
