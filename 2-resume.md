Education
---------
I pursued a degree in Computer Sciences at
the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). My PhD thesis, presented in 2008,
was a collaboration between the Departments of Computer Science and Geology at the
same University. The main topic was the design and implementation of numerical
thermo-mechanical models for the simulation of geodynamic processes.

Research
--------
As a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics, I have worked in the Laboratory
of Andean Tectonics (Univ. of Buenos Aires) and at the Geodynamical
Modelling Section of the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam. The main research
topic was the lithospheric deformation on subduction zones.

Present activities
------------------
In parallel to my research activities, I work since 2013 at GEOFON (GFZ) as Data
Centre Manager, where I'm in charge of the design and development of new
protocols and services for the seismological community.
I'm very active in the seismological community, being currently the Chair of
the Working Group II of the FDSN. Until some months ago I was also Chair of the
EIDA Technical Committee (2017-2019).
