I work as Data Manager and IT researcher at
[GEOFON](http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de) (seismological data center at
[GFZ](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de)), where he I design and develop new protocols
and services for the Seismological community.

As part of my activities within Seismology I'm currently Chairman of the [EIDA](http://www.orfeus-eu.org/data/eida/) Technical Committee (2017-2019).

As a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics I worked many years at the
[Geodynamical Modeling
Section](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geodynamic-modeling/) of GFZ. And
I still keep doing research as a part-time activity. My main research topic is
the lithospheric deformation on subduction zones and the thermo-mechanical
modeling for different scientific disciplines.

download the [full CV](/static/Quinteros-CV.pdf) in PDF format, or check my
[Google Scholar
profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8o4y6EKnIh0C&hl=es).

I developed and maintain some [software projects](/4-software.html) which you can
find interesting.
