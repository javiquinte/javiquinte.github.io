I work as Data Manager and IT researcher at
[GEOFON](http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de) (seismological data centre at
[GFZ](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de)), where I design and develop new protocols
and services for the seismological community.

As part of my activities within Seismology I'm currently Chairman of the
[EIDA Technical Committee](ETC) (2017-2019).

I collaborate regularly with various groups of the Research Data Alliance (RDA).
Currently we are wrapping up the activities done at the [Research Data Collections WG](RDA-DCWG) in a document
with [Recommendations on Research Data Collections](DCWG-Recommend)

As a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics I worked many years at the
[Geodynamic Modelling Section](Sec2.5) of GFZ. And I still keep doing research
as a part-time activity. My main research topic is the lithospheric deformation
on subduction zones and the thermo-mechanical modelling for different scientific
disciplines.

For more information you can check out my academic [Resume](/2-resume.html),
download the [full CV](/static/Quinteros-CV.pdf) in PDF format, or check my
[Google Scholar
profile](Scholar-JQ).

I developed and maintain some [software projects](/4-software.html) which you can
find interesting.
